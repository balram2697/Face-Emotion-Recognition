# Face-Emotion-Recognition

The project classifies the facial emotions in real time. The model file is trained on the following emotions:  “angry”, “disgust”, “fear”,
“happy”, “sad”, “surprise”, “neutral”. A 21 layered architecture was trained on FER 2013 dataset and it obtained an accuracy of 68%. For face detection HAar Cscade classifier was implemented.

Dependencies:
Keras, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Statistics.

To train run Train.py and for testing run Test.py. 

Model files for Face Classifier and Emotion Classifier are also provided.
